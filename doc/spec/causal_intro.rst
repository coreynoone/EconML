Introduction to Causal Inference
=================================

If you are new to causal inference, it may be helpful to walk through a quick overview of concepts and techniques that we refer to over the course of the documentation. 

You can find a high level introduction to causal inference tailored for EconML `here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/econml/how-to/>`__.

The folks at DoWhy also have a broader introduction `here <https://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/>`__.
